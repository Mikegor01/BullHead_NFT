## This is my first NFT Minitng App

This is basic a clone from DappUniversity Blockchain Mastery masterclass on NFTs. Big thanks to Gregory and team.

I also used hashlips_art_engine to generate the art which I know is not great but at least it is unique to me.

I also made the art using GIMP free software.

The NFT smartcontract has been deployed onto the rinkeby test network and all connections to Opensea are to the testnets.opensea.io
